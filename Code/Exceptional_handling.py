# Ques - even if error occured print also executed if it is not indented so why do we use finally if we just want to 
# print things which can be executed by using print function ?
# Ans - finally function helps while we are defining a function like if we use return before print then print won't 
# be executed but instead of print if we are using finally then it will be executed.
