# PYTHON STRING FORMATTING
# done in string_formatting.py

# VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT (to be done)

# A virtual environment in Python is an isolated workspace that lets you manage dependencies for a specific project without interfering with other projects or the system-wide Python installation.

# Imagine you’re working on two projects:

# Project A needs Django 3.2

# Project B needs Django 5.0

# If both are installed globally, they’ll conflict. A virtual environment solves this by keeping each project’s dependencies separate.

# python -m venv myenv       this will create a folder named myenv in the directory

# myenv\Scripts\activate      this will activate the virtual environment now every package installed goes to the environment

# typing deactivate will deactivate the virtual environment

# pip freeze        this command will gives list of all the packages installed on the environment 

# pip freeze > requirement.txt            this command will put all the list of packages in a .txt file

# pip install -r requirements.txt           to install the packages from a .txt file
